# Unity-Test-Project
A game made in unity.


Unity-Test-Project, is my first game made in unity, it is the platformer toutorial on unity I followed to make this.

I you want to copy you can download it or create your own with the toutorial on unity. :)

## Controls
- P or Esc for pause
- Space to jump
- Arrow keys to move side to side or WASD

## Rules
- You will start by spawning in a simple plain map
- If you touch a enemy you die
- Try to avoid the obstacles
- BTW the player is way too fast and jump hight is too high
- This is my first unity game and it was built off a template so dont expect too much
- You need a lot of lomentum to move
- Have fun and have a good day!
